These agents look past “does it work?” and ask “does it live in the right place?” One does whole-repo semantic grouping (with Serena) to spot misplaced/outlier functions; the other uses ast-grep to cheaply detect patterns, then escalates to an agent only when needed.

After continuous simplification, the next stop on our tour is structural refactoring: agents that scan the whole codebase and flag opportunities to improve organization and consistency.
Two workflows:
- Semantic Function Refactor 🧠 — groups functions by purpose and highlights “outliers” that likely belong elsewhere
- Go Pattern Detector 🔍 — uses fast AST pattern matching (ast-grep), and only triggers deeper agent analysis when it finds a match
